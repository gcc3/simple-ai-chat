  "quick_start": "Quick Start:\n1. Simple AI operates on a command interface and shortcuts. Commands all begin with `:`. To register a user, use command `:user add [username] [email] [password?]`. Note: Do not include the brackets in your command. ✅\nFor example, `:user add john john@example.com ********`\n2. To log in, use the command `:login [username] [password]`. 🔑\n3. Forgot your password? Reset it using the command `:user reset pass [username] [email]`. 🆘\n4. To access the Documentation and confirm Usage, click the dot (•) in the screen corner. 📄\n5. A set of chats is called a `session`. To navigate between logs in a session, use the `⬅️` and `➡️` arrow keys. 🗂️\n6. To navigate between histories (sessions), use the `⬆️` and `⬇️` arrow keys. 📜\n7. Switch to fullscreen with `F11` (⌃F11 for macOS). For split screen, use `Ctrl+|`. 🖥️\n8. To change theme, use `:theme [light|dark|terminal]` 🌈.\n9. The general `user` account is free, but you have to pay for OpenAI API tokens. You can manage your token balance on the Usage page. 💳\n10. Invite friends using the command `:invite [email]`, and both of you will receive 100K award tokens! 💌",
