  "quick_start": "Here’s a quick start guide:\n1. Simple AI operates on a command-based interface, every command begins with `:`.\nTo register a user, use command `:user add [username] [email] [password?]` (no brackets needed) ✅.\nFor example, `:user add john xxxx@zzzz.vv ********`\n* The password must be at least 8 characters long.\n2. To log in, use the command `:user login [password]` 🔑\n3. Forgot your password? Use the command `:user reset pass [username] [email]` 🆘.\n4. To access the documentation and confirm usage: click the dot (•) in the screen corner 📄.\n5. To navigate between logs, use the `⬅️` and `➡️` arrow keys. 🗂️\n6. To navigate between histories (sessions), use the `⬆️` and `⬇️` arrow keys. 📜\n7. To switch to fullscreen mode, use `F11`,  for split-screen use `Control+|` 🖥️.\n8. Change theme: use `:theme [light|dark|terminal]` 🌈.\n* The general `user` account is free; you only have to pay for tokens. You can manage your token balance on the Usage page 💳.\n\nInterested? Invite friends using the command `:invite [email]` and both of you will receive 100K award tokens! 💌",
