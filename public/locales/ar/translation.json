  "welcome": "Welcome to Simple AI! 🚀 An alternative to ChatGPT focuses on a better user experience. Just type your query into the input box and press enter to converse with the AI.\n\nHere’s a quick start guide:\n1. Simple AI operates on a command-based interface; every command begins with \":\".\nTo register a user, use command `:user add [username] [email] [password?]` (no brackets needed) ✅. \nFor example, `:user add john xxxx@zzzz.vv ********`\n* The password must be at least 8 characters long.\n2. To log in, use the command `:user login [password]` 🔑\n3. Forgot your password? Use the command `:user reset pass [username] [email]` to reset your password 🆘.\n4. To access the documentation and confirm usage: click the dot (•) in the screen corner 📄.\n5. Use the ← and → arrow keys to navigate between logs 🗂️.\n6. Shortcut: `Control + |` for split-screen mode, `Control + F11` to switch to fullscreen mode 🖥️.\n7. Change theme: use `:theme [light|dark|terminal]` 🌈.\n* The general `user` account is free; you only have to pay for tokens. You can manage your token balance on Usage page 💳.\n\nFeel generous? Invite friends using the command `:invite [email]` and both of you will receive 100K award tokens! 💌",
