Hi, in this section I will talk about language setting in this system.

Initially, if you didn't set any language, the UI will use the browser's language.

And AI will talk to with your question language.

If you want to specify a language.

Go to the Settings page.

There is languages settings here. Click a language.

Then AI will only response you only with that language.

If you want to cancel the language selection. Just click the same language again.

For command, you can use colon lang ls to list available languages.

And use colon lang use, following with a language code, to set a language.

The language settings is both for AI, application UI, and speech voice.
