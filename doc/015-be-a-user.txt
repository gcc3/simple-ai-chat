As I mentioned, I want the system like Unix.

So first thing first, you need to be a user.

Use the command colon user add, continue with your user name and email address, and the room number.

Haha, just kidding, no need for the room number.

You'll receive an email with a password and a link for verification. After you click the link, you are a user.

Then go back to the page and type colon, login, continue with your user name and password to login.

The user credentials will expire in 24 hours.

If you want to save the credentials for a shorter or longer period.

use the command colon login with your user name and password, then dash s, then 1h for one hour, or 10d for ten days.

Okay, congratulations to be a user!

See you in the next section.
