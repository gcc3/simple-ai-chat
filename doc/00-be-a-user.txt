Hi, `user`! I'm `liu`. The author of this system.

In this section I'll do a quick start to show you how to use it.

I'm a fan of `unix` and computer history. In the system I designed it to be a `unix` like system.

So first, it is a command-based system.

In this system, everything you can control with a command.

But remeber every command starts with a colon, without a colon, it will be treated as a text send to AI.

First thing first, you need to be a user.

Use the command `:user add` continue with your user name and email address, and the room number.

Just kiding, no need the room number.

You're received an Email with a password and a link for verification, after you click the link, you are a `user`.

Then go back the the page and type colon `login` continue with your user name and password.

The user credentials will be expired in 24 hours.

If you want to save the credentials for shorter or longer time.

User the command colon `login` your user name and password and dash `s`, then `1h` for one hour, or `10d` to 10 days.

Okay, congratulations! Now there is one more thing.

There is a little dot in the top bottom corner, maybe you didn't notice.

Click it, then you will be in the `back` page.

In the `back` page, there is a longer documentation.

But TLDR, you can use the command colon `use` followed by a uppper case `S`, then tab key to auto complete.

That's the command to use the documentation.

Now you can ask AI for help.

Okay, that's it, I hope you enjoy.
