Hi, I'm Heyang, the author of this system.

In the next few sections, I'll show you how to use it with a quick introduction about this syste.

As a fan of Unix and computer history, I designed this system to be Unix-like.

So firstly, it is a command-based system.

That means in this system, you can control everything with commands.

Just remember: every command must begin with a colon; otherwise, it will be treated as prompt sent to the AI.

First thing first, you need to be a user.

Use the command colon user add, continue with your user name and email address, and the room number.

Just kidding, no need for the room number.

You'll receive an email with a password and a link for verification. After you click the link, you are a user.

Then go back to the page and type colon, login, continue with your user name and password to login.

The user credentials will expire in 24 hours.

If you want to save the credentials for a shorter or longer period.

use the command colon login with your user name and password, then dash s, then 1h for one hour, or 10d for ten days.

Okay, congratulations to be a user! Now there is one more thing.

There’s a small dot in the bottom right corner—you may not have noticed it.

Click it, it will switch to the back page.

In the back page, there is a longer documentation.

But TLDR, you can use the command, colon use, followed by an uppercase S, then the tab key to auto-complete.

Yes, the command is colon use Simple AI Documentation

That's the command to enable the documentation file to AI.

Now you can ask AI for help.

Okay, that's it, I hope you enjoy.

See you in the next section.
