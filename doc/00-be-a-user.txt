Hi, user! I'm Heyang, the author of this system.

In this section, I'll do a quick start to show you how to use it.

I'm a fan of unix and computer history. In the system, I designed it to be a unix-like system.

So, first, it is a command-based system.

That means, in this system, you can control everything with commands.

But remember, every command starts with a colon. Without a colon, it will be treated as text sent to the AI.

First thing first, you need to be a user.

Use the command colon `user add`, continue with your user name and email address, and the room number.

Just kidding, no need for the room number.

You'll receive an email with a password and a link for verification. After you click the link, you are a user.

Then go back to the page and type colon, login, continue with your user name and password to login.

The user credentials will expire in 24 hours.

If you want to save the credentials for a shorter or longer period.

use the command colon login with your user name and password, then dash s, then 1h for one hour, or 10d for ten days.

Okay, congratulations to be a user! Now there is one more thing.

There is a little dot in the top bottom corner, maybe you didn't notice.

Click it, it will switch to the back page.

In the back page, there is a longer documentation.

But TLDR, you can use the command, colon `use`, followed by an uppercase S, then the tab key to auto-complete.

Yes, the command is colon `use Simple AI Documentation`

That's the command to enable the documentation file to AI.

Now you can ask AI for help.

Okay, that's it, I hope you enjoy.

See you in the next section.
