Hi, in this section, I will explain how to set the language in this system.

By default, if you haven't selected a language, the UI will use your browser's language.

And the AI will respond in the language you use to ask questions.

If you want to specify a language, you can do so as follows.

Go to the Settings page.

There are language settings here. Simply click on a language to select it.

Then the AI will only respond to you in that language.

To deselect a language, just click on it again.

For commands, use colon lang ls to list available languages.

And use colon lang use, following with a language code, to set a language.

You can use tab to auto complete the language code.

The language settings apply to the AI, the application UI, and speech voice.
