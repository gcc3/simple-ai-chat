In this section, I'll introduce the CLI, command line interface.

To install it and run it on your machine, you need a node runtime.

You can install it from the official website of node.js.

Once you have node.js installed, you can install the CLI globally using the command

npm install dash g simple dash ai dash chat

This will install the CLI globally on your machine.

Now, when you open a terminal, you can run the command s c h a t, schat to start the CLI.

It is just the same as in the web app.

That's it.
