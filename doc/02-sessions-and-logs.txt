In this section, I'll talk about sessions and logs, and how to swtich between them.

When you start the application, it will be in a session that initialized by the system.

You keep talking in this session, the AI will talk with you and know what you said before.

If you refresh the page, it will start another session and forget what you said.

In a session, every round of the talk is called a `log`. You can think the session is a set of logs.

You can use left and right key to switch between logs and up and down key to switch between sessions.

Or if you're a vim user, you may want to use `j` and `k` to switch between logs, and use `h` and `l` to switch between sessions.

But don't forget to use the ESC key to unfocus from the input first.

When you switched to a sessions and logs, and you can continue the talk.

System will create new session and use the old session as a parent session.

So basically you can talk freely from any sesion any log and system will know where or when you are.

For the command, you can use colon `ls` to list sessions.

Or use colon `log ls` to list logs.

You may notice for every session there is a ID.

You can use colon `session attach` continue with session ID to attach to a session.

You can share the session ID to your friends and let them attach to your session.

Okay, that's all for the sessions and logs.

I hope you find it useful.
