Unlike other systems, this system is minimalistic.

It doesn't even have a send button initially.

So first, just in case someone doesn't know, type your text in the input box and press Enter can submit.

If you're not focust on the input area, you can use TAB key to focus on it.

If you want to clear the input box, press the ESC key.

If you press the ESC key again, you will unfocus from the input box.
