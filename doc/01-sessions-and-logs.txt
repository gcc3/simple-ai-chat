In this section, I'll talk about sessions and logs, and how to switch between them.

When you start the application, it will be in a session initialized by the system.

You keep talking in this session; the AI will talk with you and remember what you said before.

However, if you refresh the page, it will start another session and forget what you said.

In a session, every round of conversation is called a log. You can think of the session as a set of logs.

You can use the left and right keys to switch between logs and the up and down keys to switch between sessions.

Or, if you're a vim user, you may want to use j and k to switch between logs, and use h and l to switch between sessions.

But don't forget to use the ESC key to unfocus from the input first.

When you switch to a session or log, you can continue the conversation.

The system will create a new session and use the old session as a parent session.

So basically, you can start talking freely from any session or any log.

For commands, you can use colon ls to list sessions.

Or use colon log ls to list logs of current session.

You may notice that every session has an ID.

You can use colon session attach followed by a session ID to attach to a session.

And you can share the session ID with your friends and let them attach to your session.

Okay, that's all for sessions and logs.

I hope you find it useful.
