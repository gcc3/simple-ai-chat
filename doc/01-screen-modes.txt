In this section, I will talk about how to switch between the different screen modes.

There are three screen modes:

Normal mode.

Split screen mode.

Fullscreen mode.

You can switch between these modes by using shortcuts or commands.

When you first start the application, it will be in normal mode.

You can use Ctrl with backslash key, or called, pipe key or vertical bar key, just above the Enter key on most keyboards.

Press Ctrl key with it. Then boom, you are in split screen mode.

In the split screen mode, you got a half screen input area on the left, and output area on the right.

I think most of the programmers will like this mode and this is also what I use most.

If you want to switch back to normal mode, just press control with pipe key again.

Next, for the fullscreen mode if you need to put more focus on the output area.

You can use F11 key to switch to it.

on macOS, you maybe need to use control + F11 because F11 is used by the system.

If you need to switch back, just press F11 again.

Okay, that the shortcuts for the screen mode, but you can also use the command line to switch between the modes.

:split   to switch to split screen mode.

:fullscreen  to switch to fullscreen mode.

:fullscreen off   to switch back to normal mode.

Okay, thatâ€™s all for the screen modes.

I hope you find it useful.
