In this section, I will talk about how to switch between the different screen modes.

There are three screen modes:

Normal mode.

Split screen mode.

Fullscreen mode.

You can switch between these modes by using shortcuts or commands.

When you first start the application, it will be in normal mode.

You can use Ctrl with the backslash key, also called the pipe key or vertical bar key, just above the Enter key on most keyboards.

Press the Ctrl key with it. Then, you are in split screen mode.

In split screen mode, you get a half screen input area on the left, and an output area on the right.

In split mode enter key will not trigger submission. Shift + Enter wil.

I think most programmers will like this mode and this is also what I use most.

If you want to switch back to normal mode, just press Control with the pipe key again.

Next, for fullscreen mode if you need to put more focus on the output area.

You can use the F11 key to switch to it.

On macOS, you may need to use Control + F11 because F11 is used by the system.

If you need to switch back, just press F11 again.

Okay, those are the shortcuts for the screen modes, but you can also use the command line to switch between the modes.

colon split to switch to split screen mode.

colon fullscreen to switch to fullscreen mode.

colon fullscreen off to switch back to normal mode.

Okay, thatâ€™s all for the screen modes.

The normal mode for a philosopher, the split screen mode for a programmer, and the fullscreen mode for a writer.

I hope you find it useful.
